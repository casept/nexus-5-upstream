Subject: [PATCH 00/20] qcom: Nexus 5 out-of-tree patches for v5.6

Here's my v5.6 patch series with my out-of-tree patches for the Nexus 5
and other msm8974-related systems. This gets the modem, GPU, and
vibrator working. On patches marked as needing work, see the thread on
the linux-arm-msm mailinglist.

Patches 1-3 are to get the bluetooth working and are in 5.7rc1.

Patches 4-6 are to get the modem working on msm8974 and are in 5.7rc1.

Patch 7 and 8 requires IOMMU support. Hopefully patches 9-12 will no
longer be needed once IOMMU support is in place.

Patches 13-19 are to get the vibrator working. This one needs some work.
I'm waiting for someone from Qualcomm to post support for setting the
clock duty cycle for the Qualcomm clocks since the m, n, and d clock
values are undocumented.

Patch 20 reverts the async commit support in the MSM drvier since that
causes some display problems on the old command-mode panels.
