Subject: [PATCH 00/28] qcom: Nexus 5 out-of-tree patches for v5.5

Here's my v5.5 patch series with my out-of-tree patches for the Nexus 5
and other msm8974-related systems. This gets the modem, GPU, bluetooth,
and vibrator working. On patches marked as needing work, see the thread
on the linux-arm-msm mailinglist.

Patches 1-8 are queued for the v5.6 merge window.

Patches 9-11 are to get the bluetooth working and should go into
v5.7rc1.

Patches 12-14 are to get the modem working on msm8974. This series still
needs work.

Patch 15 should hopefully be queued for v5.7

Patch 16 and 17 requires IOMMU support. Hopefully patches 18-21 will no
longer be needed once IOMMU support is in place.

Patches 22-28 are to get the vibrator working. This one needs some work.
I'm waiting for someone from Qualcomm to post support for setting the
clock duty cycle for the Qualcomm clocks since the m, n, and d clock
values are undocumented.
