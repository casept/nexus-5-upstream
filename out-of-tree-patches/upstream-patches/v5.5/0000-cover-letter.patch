Subject: [PATCH 00/25] qcom: Nexus 5 out-of-tree patches for v5.5

Here's my v5.5 patch series with my out-of-tree patches for the Nexus 5
and other msm8974-related systems. This gets the modem, GPU, and
vibrator working. On patches marked as needing work, see the thread on
the linux-arm-msm mailinglist.

Patches 1-8 are queued for the v5.6 merge window.

Patches 9-11 are to get the modem working on msm8974. This series still
needs work.

Patch 12 should hopefully be queued for v5.7

Patch 13 and 14 requires IOMMU support. Hopefully patches 15-18 will no
longer be needed once IOMMU support is in place.

Patches 19-25 are to get the vibrator working. This one needs some work.
I'm waiting for someone from Qualcomm to post support for setting the
clock duty cycle for the Qualcomm clocks since the m, n, and d clock
values are undocumented.
